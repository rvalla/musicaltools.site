# musiCal Tools: website

This is the site for **musiCal** project. I'm getting old and over time I've already played with many tools related to music analysis and composition. This website attempts to bring all those tools, new and old, together in one place.  

Visit site at [musicaltools.gitlab.io](https://musicaltools.gitlab.io).
